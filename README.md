    How do I approach designing software?
        What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
        design skills that my work in the project has helped me craft were applying textures, creating shapes, creating light sources, and making textures have different kinds of reflection to said light source
        What design process did you follow for your project work?
        design process i followed for my project work was planning out what I intended to do for my project, then working on each part individually each week such as creating the shapes in the first week, then applying textures the next.
        How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
        These tactics from my design approached can be applied in any future work because working on a project in steps and ensuring each step functions properly is a great way too slowly build your work towards your final goal while ensuring it meets all requirements along the way.
    How do I approach developing programs?
        What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
        new development strategies I used while working on my 3d scene were making small adjustments working towards my final goal while ensuring the code maintained functionality.
        How did iteration factor into your development?
        iteration factor into my development by doing small iterations of the project and making sure they work so that I can build the project towards my final goal.
        How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
        each milestone had one of the requirements of the project so each week we worked on an iteration of the project and with each milestone completed we were a step closer too completing the project.
    How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
        computational graphics and visualizations gave me knowledge that can be used in all my future courses making them easier in a sense with the prior knowledge I gained from this course allowing for my academic life too be easier than without said knowledge.
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
        computationla graphics and visualization gave me knowledge that will surely be useful in my future proffesional career since it will give me knowledge that can be transfered into the real world as well as skills that can be useful in any program whether its OpenGL again or a different program like mysql.
